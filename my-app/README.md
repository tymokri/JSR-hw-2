React component Card V2

1. Make component Card
2. The component accepts 2 props - title and text
3. It is necessary to accept them in the component and render them in the appropriate places
4. If some props is missing (was not passed to the component), then we do not render the html code that turns it around
5. Connect the component to the App.js and render 3 times (sending props in turn):
    ~ 1. At the first rendering, we pass only the title
    ~ 2. In the second case, only text
    ~ 3. In the third case, both props
